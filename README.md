this is just a fork of the electron quick start that loads twitch.tv and it actually supports viewing ads, using the search bar, and of course, interacting with extensions

to see the exemplary engineering that went into making this incredible feat, check out [the commit](https://github.com/shrugs/better-twitch-desktop/commit/9770976eadfb4bfcdad2a02255e8eada0d96df2e#diff-7a9076d6d94e62c13d641aa71f19ae8eR19)

yes, that's it. no, I don't know how the proprietary app is so broken.

# electron-quick-start

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](https://electronjs.org/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start).
